## Usage:

- Provided instructions and examples listed below.
  - You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. For this project, you started off by downloading inquirer. Once Inquirer was downloaded, it was time to create an array of objects will all of the question and input types the user would be prompted with. Then it was time to create a generateMarkdown function on a different .js document where you would call in each of the user's answers and format the readme how you would like it to be set up. The last portion of this project was to go back to the index.js and call each of the functions to a writeFile function so all of the information would be created on a brand new md.
